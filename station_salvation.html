                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>Station Salvation</i> is a third-person sci-fi shooter 
                        set amidst an assault on an expansive space station. 
                        The goal of the game is to traverse as far as as you can 
                        while eliminating as many invading aliens as possible before 
                        reaching the end. This video game was created for Game Design 
                        2 course during my second semester at CSU East Bay.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Plot</h2>
                    <p>
                        An armed survivor is tasked with clearing as much space of hostiles as they can,
                        while making their way to the extraction point.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Setting</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game takes place on a space station deep in space, far into the future.
                        A foreign group of aliens have boarded the station, eliminating any humans 
                        on sight.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Restraints</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since this was a school project, and taking into account the limitaions
                        of the hardware we were using, as well as the limited amount of time,
                        we were not able to accomplish all the goals we have set for ourselves 
                        and had to scrap a majority of our combined concepts.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        During this project, I worked with four other students and acted as the project lead as well as the 
                        head developer/blueprint manager. The task that was entrusted to me was to lead the group in a direction 
                        that would allow for optimal productivity, as well as provide code that would allow the basic mechanics 
                        of the game to function, i.e., combat system, health system, and enemy encounters.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Process</h2>
                <img src="images/space station map concept.jpg" class="rounded " width="50%" height="50%" alt="Sketch">
                    <p class="mt-2">
                        For the initial process of <i>Station Salvation</i> I started to sketch a basic layout of the playable 
                        areas, giving both the map/level designer and the asset/texture designer of the group a base understanding 
                        of what we are trying to accomplish.
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        Once the tasks had been distributed and everyone understood their assignments, I then started to work
                        on coding/blueprinting the combat mechanics, health system, and movement for both the playerable 
                        character and enemies.

                        After I had finished my tasks and my classmates had completed theirs, we then combined all our
                        progress into a single unreal project and began to test for any errors.

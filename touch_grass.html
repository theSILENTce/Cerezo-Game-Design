                    <p>
                        The <i>Touch Grass</i> app is a figma prototype created for my UX Design class at CSU East Bay,
                        used to showcase our creative skills and implement design principles that we learned from UI Design.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Pitch</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the modern era, phones are everywhere, and people are confined within their homes.
                        However, with this app, we are hopefully able to remedy that situation.

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Product Brief</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>Touch Grass</i> is a mobile app that aims to help and encourage users to go outside, either with friends or by 
                        themselves. The app achieves this goal by collecting data on locations near the user, and comparing the location 
                        to friends' interests.
                    </p>



                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">What We Want To Acomplish</h2>
                    <p>
                        We want to create a mobile app that motivates the user to go outside alone or with company. By doing so, it will improve 
                        the user's mental health, encouraging them to go outside, discover new experiences, as well as give them an opportunity to 
                        hang out with friends and family.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        My contribution toward this project was helping with data collection, ensuring that we were able to provide services
                        that would better suit our target demographic; also, providing a seemless UX/UI design for our app so that the user 
                        interface would be visually appealing and easy to understand; as well as making sure the functionality of the
                        prototype was functioning as it should.
                    </p>
    
                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Brainstrom</h2>
                    <p class="mt-2">
                        From the initial stages of this project, our group brainstromed together on what types of problems that we are
                        noticing from the world around us. And that problem that we noticed revolved around personal wellness and mental health.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8; margin-right: 67%;">The Problem</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 15%;">
                            Ever since the pandemic and shelter in place, everyone has found complacency within their homes and tends to spend days 
                            stuck inside. During this time, everyday activities were restricted to things that could only be done inside the comfort 
                            of your own home or your local backyards. From this, people indulged in their hobbies ranging from watching shows, reading 
                            books, arts and crafts, cooking, and even playing video games. However, the one thing that was similar between all these 
                            hobbies was that they were done in the comfort of your own home. It quickly became apparent that although people were enjoying 
                            their own hobbies in the comfort of their own homes, many people were finding themselves increasingly dissatisfied and noticing 
                            their mental happiness deteriorating. Although being home is a relaxing place where people can rest and sleep, people still 
                            need to be outside in order to have a healthy balance of personal wellness and mental health. Our goal is to get people to leave 
                            their house and experience something outside. Whether it's taking a hike, walking to the local mall, or even meeting up with your 
                            grandparents, any form of being outside is a healthy break from the screens we see and the games we play. To do this, we will 
                            be employing the use of screens through the use of mobile smart phones that everybody has access to all day. Even if it's a screen, 
                            it can be used as a vehicle to motivate people to leave the house, and explore their local surroundings.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 15%;">
                            Steven is a young adult who has spent the majority of his free time at home watching Netflix. He wants to start spending less 
                            time watching Netflix and instead exploring his local area and getting away from his house, but needs help finding local spots 
                            and being reminded to get outside.

                    <p class="mt-2">
                        For our interview process, we wrote open-ended general questions that related to our topic and that were easy 
                        enough for the interviewee to slowly get accustomed to the interview process. Some of the open-ended general questions
                        that we asked them were, "What is a quick rundown of your weekly routine?" and "How do you feel about local events?" 
                        Once the open-ended general questions had been asked, we then asked deeper questions to help us better understand the mindset 
                        and the rhythms of our target demographic. The deep questions that we asked our interviewees were, "Would the type of 
                        location change how you plan this experience?" and "If you didn't have company, how would that change how you go out?"
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">Survey</h2>
                    <p>
                        After we conducted our interviews, we then used the data we collected from them to create a survey that would help us 
                        gauge a broader portion of the life styles of our target demographic, which would help us further narrow down what the 
                        key features should be, as well as the types of functionality we would be a vocal point on to help cater to the users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upon collecting all the data from both our interviews and surveys, we then created two extreem personas that would
                        act as base models of the types of users that will be using our app.
                        <br><br>
                        The two personas that we decided to create were Jamiroquai, a full-time student within his second semester who spends 
                        most of his time doing assignments, which leaves him with little time left in the day to do any sort of recreational 
                        activities; Emily, another full-time student who is nearing the end of their academic career and has a balanced 
                        school and social life.
                    </p>

                        Keeping the Personas in mind, we then started to lay out the key features and basic flow of how we wanted our app to function.

                        Once the group had decided on what the site map would look like, the task for creating a wire frame came to me. 
                        Upon creating the wire frame we all took input from eachother, taking in to account the main design principles
                        that would allow for an easy to understand interface for the suers to interact with.

                    <h3 style="color: #9F53D8;">LoFi Prototype</h3>
                        <img src="images/touch_grass-lofi.png" class="rounded mb-3" width="75%" height="75%" alt="LoFi Prototype">
                        <p>
                            For the LoFi prototype, I adapted the wireframes and began to add basic functionality using one of the free prototypes
                            from the Figma marketplace. Some features that did not come within the built prototpye, were created using Figma's built-in tools.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the problems that I faced when remapping the free prototype to account for the aesthetic and functionality we were
                            aiming for, which include some of its own preexisting assets along with our custom-made assets. What I noticed was that some 
                            of the pages would prevent us from scrolling further into the page. For instance, on the main page of the app, once we 
                            scrolled to the bottom of the page, we were locked in place and couldn't scroll back up. A similar problem occurred with another 
                            page, but instead of not being able to scroll back up, the scrolling function was non-existent.
                        </p>
                    <h3 style="color: #9F53D8;">HiFi Prototype</h3>
                        <img src="images/touch_grass-HiFi.png" class="rounded mb-3" width="75%" height="75%" alt="HiFi Prototype">
                        <p>
                            For the HiFi prototype, we were able to remedy the problems that we encountered with our LoFi prototype by expanding their page's bottom 
                            to accommodate the page's other assets. I also added color and images shared by the visual designer to better fit the theme and title of our 
                            app, "grass." Another refinement added to the HiFi prototype was the addition of a mock-up login page and sign-up page, as well as functioning
                            previous page controls that allow the user to backtrack to the previous page they were on.

                <h2 class="mt-3" style="color: #9F53D8;">User Testing</h2>

                        <img src="images/touch_grass-maze_testing.png" class="rounded mb-3" width="55%" height="55%" alt="Maze Test Image">
                        <p>
                            After the creation of the HiFi prototype, we then pushed it out for user testing on both the Maze platform and in-person testing to get a better
                            understanding of how our app would function without the guidance  of the creators.
                            <br><br>
                            From what we gathered from the initial testing, some users were confused about some of the buttons functionality as they had little indication
                            of what they were meant to do. From this feedback, we added some extra buttons for multiple functionality as well as small text under specific buttons
                            to help clerify their functionality and cater to a better user experience.
